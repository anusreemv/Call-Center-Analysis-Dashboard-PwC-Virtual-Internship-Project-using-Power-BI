## ❗ Problem Statement

Call centers receive thousands of customer queries daily, and it's vital to maintain high standards of responsiveness, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction. The challenge lies in:

- Monitoring KPIs like Call Volume, CSAT, Handle Time, and Resolution Rate.
- Identifying top and low-performing agents.
- Detecting trends in call volume by time, topic, and resolution status.
- Recommending improvements based on data-driven insights.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard creation, modeling, and DAX measures.
- **Power Query Editor** – Data transformation and cleaning.
- **Microsoft Excel** – Raw data source.
- **DAX** – Custom measures and KPIs (e.g., CSAT%, AHT, issue resolution rate).

---

## 🔍 Insights

- 🔍 **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction)** is low at **49.90%**, indicating service dissatisfaction.
- 🔍 The majority of calls are **unresolved (72.9%)**, which strongly correlates with low CSAT.
- 🔍 Highest call volumes were for **Streaming** and **Technical Support** topics.
- 🔍 **Jim** resolved the most issues (**485**), while **Diane** had the lowest **average handle time**.
- 🔍 Peak call hours are between **12 PM and 3 PM**, requiring optimal staffing during these times.

## 💡 Recommendations

- 💡 **Improve resolution rate** by upskilling agents and optimizing the ticket triage process.
- 💡 **Conduct training sessions** for agents with high call abandonment or low CSAT scores.
- 💡 **Boost customer satisfaction** by reducing average handle and answer times.
