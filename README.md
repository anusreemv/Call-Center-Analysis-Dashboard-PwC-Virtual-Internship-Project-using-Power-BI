## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Call centers receive thousands of customer queries daily, and it's vital to maintain high standards of responsiveness, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction. The challenge lies in:

- Monitoring KPIs like Call Volume, CSAT, Handle Time, and Resolution Rate.
- Identifying top and low-performing agents.
- Detecting trends in call volume by time, topic, and resolution status.
- Recommending improvements based on data-driven insights.

---

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** ‚Äì Dashboard creation, modeling, and DAX measures.
- **Power Query Editor** ‚Äì Data transformation and cleaning.
- **Microsoft Excel** ‚Äì Raw data source.
- **DAX** ‚Äì Custom measures and KPIs (e.g., CSAT%, AHT, issue resolution rate).

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs are tracked and analyzed for continuous improvement:

- **Average Handle Time (AHT):**  
  Measures the average time spent by agents on a customer call (talk time, hold time, wrap-up).

- **First Call Resolution (FCR):**  
  Tracks the percentage of customer issues resolved during the first interaction, reducing the need for follow-up calls.

- **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):**  
  Captures customer satisfaction based on post-call surveys.

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS):**  
  Measures customer loyalty by evaluating the likelihood of customers recommending the service to others.

- **Service Level:**  
  The percentage of calls answered within a specified time, e.g., 80% of calls answered within 30 seconds.

- **Abandonment Rate:**  
  Tracks the percentage of calls where customers hang up before speaking to an agent.

- **Agent Utilization Rate:**  
  Indicates the proportion of time agents are actively handling calls versus idle time.

- **Call Volume:**  
  The total number of calls received by the call center within a specific period.

- **Occupancy Rate:**  
  Measures how much time agents spend actively engaged with calls compared to their total available time.

- **Call Transfer Rate:**  
  The percentage of calls that require transferring to another agent or department.

- **Response Time:**  
  The average time taken for agents to respond to the customer‚Äôs initial query.

## üîç Insights

- **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction)** is low at **49.90%**, indicating service dissatisfaction.
- The majority of calls are **unresolved (72.9%)**, which strongly correlates with low CSAT.
- Highest call volumes were for **Streaming** and **Technical Support** topics.
- **Jim** resolved the most issues (**485**), while **Diane** had the lowest **average handle time**.
- Peak call hours are between **12 PM and 3 PM**, requiring optimal staffing during these times.

---

## üí° Recommendations

- **Improve resolution rate** by upskilling agents and optimizing the ticket triage process.
- **Conduct training sessions** for agents with high call abandonment or low CSAT scores.
- **Boost customer satisfaction** by reducing average handle and answer times.
- **Reschedule agent shifts** to better align with peak call hours.
- **Investigate unresolved calls** by topic to find root causes and apply corrective action.
